                            Dear Learners.<br><br>
                            CIEFAL has provided opportunities to thousands of learners in the past in acquiring academic and competitive education for career promotion and gainful employment under the guidance of Mr. Ainul Haque. So welcome to the Cambridge Institute of English for Advanced Learning.<br><br>
                            I have great pleasure in presenting to you all a common prospectus of Cambridge Institute of English for Advanced Learning (CIEFAL) to look forward to making you aware about spoken English, advanced education, and writing English for practical purposes. It is a matter of satisfaction for us that we speak of informal and formal English. There is another expression—"Colloquial English"—that shows English can be used for multiple purposes. The English that we use in law courts, serious writing, print media, and official contexts is formal written English. But the English we use in ordinary conversation is informal spoken English. The rules of grammar are the same in both; there are just some differences in the usage. The structures are more flexible in spoken English.<br><br>
                            Another essential point in spoken English is that we have to be particular—not about spelling but about pronunciation and accent. CIEFAL guides precisely to that purpose too. It presents the different elements of English grammar to look forward to enlightening specific structures, idioms, and phrasal verbs that we use while speaking good and correct English.<br><br>
                            Truly speaking, CIEFAL, under the guidance of Mr. Ainul Haque, has trained millions of learners in the past from 2001 onwards in imparting higher English communication skills for their career promotion and gainful employment. The institute is keen to harness the potential of general and Madrasa students through the teaching-learning process with a view to providing them sinew so as to reach the pinnacle of their career. We take pride in the fact that any learner of English will benefit from the systematic presentations of the teaching-learning process. In this institute, they will attain a sound knowledge of general education and English Language and Literature to meet all their possible needs. They must focus their attention on the explanations or formulas delivered in the class of each batch. This precision and particularity, I am confident, will enable you to enhance your knowledge, skills, and job prospects. I wish you all success in your career and planning endeavours and hope that the course of CIEFAL selected by you will stand you in good stead in life.<br><br>
